// no user object included. (We originally assumed { accessToken, user },
// which caused a bug where the signed-in user would "disappear" after a
// page refresh — see AuthContext.tsx for how we now load the user
// separately.)
//
// The backend also sets a refresh token as an HttpOnly cookie, but that
// cookie is invisible to our JavaScript code (which is the point of it
// being HttpOnly — it protects the refresh token from XSS attacks).
